# Summary

### Language Models

### 2018

### [`GPT` | Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf)

<details>

 **Basics**
 - For `multi-task` Natural Language Understanding (NLU) objectives such as question answering, semantic similarity, document classification etc.
 - Some of these tasks are part of [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) multi-task benchmark.
 - Supervised learning suffer from lack of large annotated dataset and quality. Learning from raw text removes dependence of on supervised only methods.

 **GPT**
 - GPT (Generative Pre-Training) is a `semi-supervised` approach with `unsupervised pre-training` and `supervised fine-tuning`. 
 - `Two stages`, Generative Pre-Training on unlabeled data, Discriminative Finetuning for each specific task with task aware input transformation and minimal model architecture change.
 - GPT aquires useful linguistic knowledge for `downstream tasks` and outperforms specifically crafted task specific models.
 - Goal is to `learn universal representation` to apply to wide range of tasks with little adaptation.
 -  Input text is processed as single contiguous sequence of tokens.
 - `Training` requires `large corpus of unlabeled data` and `manually annotated data` for each target task.

 **Model**
 - `Transformer` is used for model architecture due ability `handle long-term dependencies` in text.
 - Multi-layer `transformer decoder` is used for language modeling.
 - Models is multiple layer `decoder only transformer` with masked self attention heads.
 - `Learned positional embedding` is used instead of sinusoidal in original transformers.

 **Unsupervised Pre-training**
 - `Pre-training` acts as `regularizer` providing `better generalization` in deep neural nets. 
 - `Unsupervised pretraining` goal is to find `good initialization point` instead of modifying supervised objective.
 - Unsupervised pretraining objective based on `context window of tokens` predicts likelihood the next token.

 **Supervised Fine-tuning**
 - Uses `labeled dataset` for supervised task. Input sequence of tokens `x1, x2, ..., xN` has output label `y`.
 - An `additional linear ouput layer` is added after final layer of transformer to predict `y` for given task.
 - Uses `label prediction objective` and additionally `language modeling as auxiliary objective` (loss) of unsupervised pre-training for supervised-finetuning.
 - `Extra parameters` added to unsupervised pre-trained model is final linear layer weights $W_y$ and embedding for delimiter tokens. 

 **Input Transformation**
 - `Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)` used for sub-word tokenization.
 - Instead of using task specific architectures, the inputs are `converted to sequence of tokens` that the pretrained model can process.
 - Includes `start and end tokens` for each input to pretrained model, `<s>`, `<e>`.
 - For `text entailment`, premise `p` and hypothesis `h` token sequence inlcude delimiter token `$` between them.
 - For `document QA` (Question Answering) and common sense reasoning include document `z`, a question `q`, a set of answers $a_k$. Document context, question and each individual answer is concatenated with delimiter token in between to produce input data to the pretrained model ($z$, $q$, $\\$$, $a_1$), ($z$, $q$, $\\$$, $a_2$), ..., ($z$, $q$, $\\$$, $a_K$). Softmax layer is used to produce output distribution over all possible answers. 
 - For `sentence similarity` with two sentence sequence of tokens `s1`, `s2` there is no ordering. Start, end tokens are added with delimiter between the sentences to produce output. Also the sentences are swapped to again produce output both which is concatenated before feeding to linear layer.

 **Datasets**
 - Natural Language inference (NLI): SNLI, MNLI, QNLI.
 - Question Answering: SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset).
 - Semantic Similarity: Quora Question Pairs (QQP), Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark (STS-B), Microsoft Paraphrase corpus (MRPC).

### [`BERT` | BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)
 
<details>  

 **Prerequisite** 
 - GPT-1 paper.

 **Applying Pre-trained Language Representations to Downstream tasks**
 - `Two strategies` for applying pre-trained language representations downstream tasks. They are `fine-tuning` and `feature-based`.
 - Feature-based representations are applied as `additional features` to task-specific architectures.
 - Fine-tuning approaches like `GPT` introduces `minimal task specific parameters`. It is trained by downstream tasks by `fine-tuning all pre-trained parameters`.

 **Limitations of existing Unidirectional Language Models**
 - Standard language models are `unidirectional`. `GPT` uses `left-to-right` architecture, where can `only attend to previous tokens` in self attention layer by masking future tokens.
 - This can be `harmful` when fine-tuning on `token-level tasks like Question Answering`, which requires context incorporated from both directions.

 **BERT**
 - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a `language representation model` introduced in the paper.
 - `Similar to GPT`, BERT has pre-training and fine-tuning stage. Each downstream task has separate finetuned model even if they are initialized with same pre-trained model parameters.
 - In contrast to GPT which is transformer decoder model due to left only context, bidirectional context model BERT is a `transformer encoder model`.
 - Designed to `pretrain` deep bidirectional representations from `unlabeled data` by `jointly conditioning on left and right context` in all layers.
 - `An additional output layer` is added to create `SOTA (state-of-the-art)` models that performs well on sentence-level and token-level tasks. Tasks include QA, language inference etc.
 - `Alleviates constraints` of unidirectional models (e.g. GPT) by introducing `Masked Language Model (MLM)` pre-training task. 
 - Also uses `Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)` task to jointly pretrain on text-pair representations.
 - Similar to GPT, during finetuning `all parameters are fine-tuned`.
 - For finetuning task specific input and outputs are added. Adding an extra output layer on top of pre-trained model can be used for classification, sentiment analysis etc.
 - BERT is effective in both feature-based (extracting fixed features from pre-trained network) and fine-tuning (all parameters including pre-trained) approaches.
 - `Increasing model size` will lead to `continual improvement` on large scale tasks.
 - Uses `WordPiece` tokenization.
 
 **Special Tokens**
 - `[CLS]` token added in front of every training example. `Final state` corresponding to this token is used as aggregate representation for `classification tasks`.
 - `[SEP]` special separator token for separating sentence pairs. It can be used for separating question and answers. 
 - `[MASK]` token is used for pre-training and not used in fine-tuning.
 
 **Input and Ouput Representations**
 - BERT input representation can unambiguously handle both single and paired sentence `<question, answer>` in one token sequence.
 - Here, a sentence is considered as `arbitrary span of contiguous text`, rather than liguistic sentence.
 - Sequence here is referred as `input token sequence` to BERT which can be a `single sentence or pair of sentences packed together`.
 - `Learned positional embedding` is also added to each tokens for indicating whether it belongs to sentence A or B.
 
 **Masked Language Model (MLM)**
 - MLM (Cloze Task) used for pre-training `randomly masks some input tokens`, and the objective is to `predict original vocabulary id` based only on context. 
 - MLM enables representations to `fuse left and right context`.
 - Bidirectional conditioning would allow each word indirectly see itself.
 - `[Mask]` token appears only in pre-training and not in fine-tuning. To mitigate this, words are not always replaced with mask tokens. 
 - 80% of the times word is replaced with mask token, 10% time with random token and 10% of the times with same token. Cross entropy loss is used to predict original token. Example, unlabeled sentence, `my dog is hairy`. 80% of the time label will be mask token, `my dog is [mask]`. 10% of the time random word, `my dog is apple` and 10% of the time same word, `my dog is hairy`.
 - Masked LM only makes prediction on 15% of the token each batch. MLM does not know which words it needs predict or which have been replaced with random words.
 
 **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**
 - Used for pre-training and shown to be beneficial for QA and NLI.
 - Downstream tasks like `Question Answering (QA)`, `Natural Language Inference (NLI)` are based on `relationship between two sentences`, which is not directly captured by language modeling. 
 - For this task, 50% of the time sentence B is `actual next sentence` to sentence A labeled with `IsNext`. Rest of the 50% time sentence B is `randomly chosen` from corpus and labeled by `NotNext`.
 - Input example, `[CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP] he bought a gallon of [MASK] milk [SEP]` and output label `IsNext`.
 - Input example, `[CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP] penguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]` and output label `NotNext`.

### Foundation Models

### 2021

### [`Foundation Models` | On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)

 <details>

**Foundation Models**
- `Foundation models` are models trained on `broad data` generally trained using `self-supervised learning at scale`, that can be adapted (e.g., fine-tune) to wide range of downstream tasks. Example include, BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3, CLIP etc.
- Foundation model provide `general-purpose engine` for `processing multimodal information`.
- They are based on `deep neural networks (DNN)` and `self-supervised learning (SSL)`.  
- Incentivizes `homogenization`, which is consolidation of methodologies for building ML systems across wide range of applications.
- Transfer learning makes it possible, Scale makes it powerlful. Their `scale` result in `emergent capabilities`.
- Led to unprecedented level of homogenization. `Almost all SOTA NLP models adapted` from few `foundation models, BERT, RoBERTa, BART, T5,` etc.'
- Led to surprising emergence due to scale, `in-context learning` in 175B parameter GPT-3. `In-context learning` allows `adaptation to downstream tasks by` providing it with `prompt`.
- Can `centralize information` from all data `from various modalities (e.g., text, image, audio)` and can be `adapted` to wide range of `downstream tasks (e.g., QA, image captioning, following instructions, object recognition).`
- `Foundation model itself is incomplete`, but serves as `common basis` from which many `task-specific models` built via adaptation.

**Basic Knowledge** 
- In deep learning, `pretraining` is a dominant `transfer learning approach`.
- In `self-supervised learning` pretraining task is derived from `unlabeled data`.
- `Transformer` model architecture leverages `hardware parallelism` to train more expressive models.

**Memory**
- Important to distinguish between `explicit facts` that can be `stored in external memory storage` (e.g., vector database) and `implicit knowledge` reflected through `trainable weights of network.`
- `Decoupling explicit and implicit knowledge` enjoy multiple `benefits` compared to implicitly encoding all information together through network weights. [🔗 paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08909.pdf)
- This separation `mitigates inflation in model size`, `number of parameters` needed to store growing amounts of knowledge. It is also `key to memory update (model patching), manipulation and adaptation`. [🔗 paper link](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/6b493230205f780e1bc26945df7481e5-Paper.pdf)

**Adaptations**
- `Low storage adaptation`, approaches include, `fine-tuning final layer weights`, `only bias vectors`, `low rank weight tensors`, .
- `Low memory adaptations` include, `gradient checkpointing` to trade off computation and memory. 

**Temporal Adaptations**
- `Information is constantly changing` like clothing style, new heads of state elected. This `temporal shift` presents a problem due to computationally demanding nature of training foundation models.
- `Temporarily-partioned` diagnostic datasets help quantify the rate at which language models become outdated.
- An alternative to addressing `temporal shift` is to design `retrieval-based (sami-parametric) models`, which `augment the model` input with `additional context retrieved from large human-interpretable databases`. In this case, `adaptation` corresponds to `updating` individual units of `information in database`. 

**Continual Learning**
- A natural extension of adaptation is `continual learning` or `continual adaptation`, in order to `keep model's knowledge up-to-date` with world events, `continually add data` from new domain or `modalities`.
- A problem of this is `continual learning` induces `catastrophic forgetting` in neural networks, where `old tasks or data are rapidly forgotten` with train distribution changes.
- `Memory mechanisms` have shown promise for continual learning in foundation models.
- `Techniques for localizing knowledge` in foundation model in order to `make targetted parameter updates` may help prevent forgetting, but `repeated application` of such updates `induce significant forgetting`.

**Efficient Knowledge Representation**
- `Retrieval-based` models such as `REALM, RAG, RETRO` take `different approach` to model design `than simply increasing model parameters`.
- Instead of trying to `accumulate implicit-knowledge` from ever larger datasets `directly to DNN model` with billions of parameters, `retrieval-based` methods `store knowledge outside model parameters` in form of text passages, `capturing knowledge` in form of `dense vector representations`.
- These models use `top-k` search mechanisms to extract knowledge based on each input, `while keeping the DNN model small`.
- This results in `improved maintainability` of the model as developers can `update knowledge by replacing text passage`, its dense vector representation, metadata, `without needing to train large DNN`.

**Drawbacks**
- `Defects` of the model are `inherited` to all adapted models `downstream`.
- `Homogenization` create single point of failure. Susceptible to `adversarial examples`, `data poisoning attack`, which could be transfered to adapted applications.
- `Emergence` properties of foundation models generate `substantial uncertainty` over capabilities.
- Existing foundation models are able to `memorize sensitive information` in training data and `regurgitate` such data `when queried` via standard API.

### Controllable Image Synthesis

### 2023

### [`DragGAN` | Drag Your GAN: Interactive Point-based Manipulation on the Generative Image Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10973)

 <details>

**Basics**
- `Ideal controllable image synthesis` approaches should have, 1) `flexibility:` able to `control` different `spatial properties like position, shape, pose, expression` of generated objects; 2) `Precision:` `control` spatial properties `with high precision`; 3) `Generality:` should be `applicable to different objects` without limiting to certain categories.
- To `track points in videos`, an obvious approach is through `optical flow estimation between consecutive frames`.

 **Previous Approaches**
 - `Previous GAN` based methods `gain controllability` by using `manually annotated training data` or `prior 3D model` often lacking flexibility, precision, and generality. These fail to generalize to new object categories.
 - `Text guided` image synthesis `lacks precision and flexibility` in term of editing spatial attributes. For example, moving object by specific number of pixels. 

 **DragGAN** 
 - DragGAN is a `point-based interactive image editing method` not requiring additional tracking models. It `outperforms SOTA` point-based tracking approaches like `RAFT` and `PIPs`.
 - It allows `edit` of `pose, shape, expression, layout` accross `diverse object` categories.
 - User `sets some handle points` in interactive manner by clicking and `corresponding target point pairs` in manner of `(handle point, target point)`. This method will `move handle points to target points` of GAN-generated images.
 - Can also `use bindary masks to edit on only masked location by denoting movable region`. `Mask reduces ambiguity` and `keeps certain regions fixed`.
 - `Handling more than one point` with precision control `enables more diverse and accurate image manipulation`.
 - This approach can `hallucinate occlued content`, like `teeth inside a lion's mouth`, and can `deform following object's rigidity`, like `beding a horse leg`.
  

**GAN Properties**
 - DragGAN is built on `key insight` that the `feature space of GAN is sufficiently discriminative` to enable both motion supervision and precision point tracking.
 - DragGAN `deformation` is performed on `learned image manifold of a GAN`, which `tend to obey underlying object structure`.

**StyleGAN Terminology**
- In `StyleGAN2`, a 512 dimension latent code `z` mapped to 512 dimensional intermediate latent code `w` via `mapping network`. The space of `w` is refered to as `W`.
- Generator `G` produces output image, `I = G(w)` from latent code `w`. `w` is copied several times and sent to different layers to control different attributes.
- Different `w` can be sent to `l` different layers which is `W+` space. `This space` is less constrained and `more expressive`.
- As generator `G` learns to `map low dimensional space to high dimensional space`, it can be seen as `modelling image manifold`.

**Method**
- `Optimizing latent codes` that incrementatly moves handle points to target location and `point tracking method` to faithfully trace trajectory of handle points.
- User inputs `handle points and target points with each point having (x, y) location`. Each `handle point have corresponding target point pair`.
- `Motion supervision drives handle points to target points`. `Point tracking updates handle points` to track the object in image. This process `continues` until `handle point reaches corresponding target point`.
- Manipulation is performed in `optimization` manner. Each optimization has two steps, `motion supervision` and `point tracking`.
- After `each motion supervision` step point moves `small step`, but the `amount is unknown`.
- Point tracking is required because if handle points (e.g., nose of lion) are not accurately updated, then in next motion supervision step it will move wrong points (e.g., face of lion).

**Motion Supervision**
- Intermediate features of generator is discriminative enough such that simple loss is enough to supervise motion.
- Feature map `F` after `6th block of StyleGAN2` is considered as it gives good trade-off between discriminativeness and resolution. 
- Feature map `F` is `resized` to `same size as final image` via `bilinear interpolation`.
- At `each motion supervision step`, the `loss` is used to `optimize` latent code `w` for one step.
- Spatial attributes of image affected of `w` for first `6 layers` while remaining ones affect appearence. Thus, `w` is updated for only first 6 layers while fixing others to preserve appearance. 


**Point Tracking**
- Feature map `F` after `6th block of StyleGAN2` is also considered here with 256x256 resolution and interpolated to same size as image if needed.

**Input Image Editing**
- Performed using `GAN Inversion` techniques that `embeds` input images to `StyleGAN latent space`.
 
**Datasets**
- FFHQ, AFHQCat, LSUN Car, LSUN Cat, Landscapes HQ.

**Limitations**
- `Extrapolation capability` of DragGAN is `limited by diversity of training data`. `Deviating` from `training data may lead to artifacts`.
- `Handle points` in `texture-rich` location should be picked as texture-less regions suffer from drift in tracking.
