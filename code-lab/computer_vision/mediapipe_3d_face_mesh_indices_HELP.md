## Blender Get Mesh Indices How To

To get indices of the object enable Blender Addon MesaureIt, go right sidebar(`N` key) on `3d viewport` and select Vertices button on `Mesh Debug` option.

Alternate way in Blender 2.8+ is to tick Developer Extras option on `Preferences > Developer Extras` Option and tick `Developer > Indices` on Overlays button on 3d viewport.
